# TODO List

## Bugs

- [ ] **[HIGH]** Fix bottom drawer swipe-down close gesture stopping after inner touch
  - Description: On mobile, the bottom drawer's swipe-down close gesture works when the drawer is first opened, but stops firing as soon as the user taps or touches any content inside the drawer — the swipe no longer dismisses the drawer and the user has to find another close mechanism. Expected behavior is for the swipe-down dismiss gesture to remain active for the lifetime of the open drawer, independent of whether its inner content has been interacted with. Likely causes: inner touch handlers calling `stopPropagation()` so the drawer's `touchstart`/`touchmove`/`touchend` listeners never receive subsequent gestures; or the gesture state machine (drag-in-progress flag, captured start Y) getting stranded or reset by an inner touch and never re-arming. Investigate the drawer's swipe-handling block in `main.js` (grep with offset/limit since `main.js` is >25k tokens) and confirm the listeners are attached to the drawer container and don't bail based on `event.target` not being the drawer itself.

## Features

- [x] **[HIGH]** Fix STACK mobile layout — collapse mainTitle dead space, render page dots, hide desktop footer counts
  - Description: The ≤700px STACK breakpoint is still rendering broken after the last corrective PR. Three distinct issues compound into the screenshot's appearance: (1) `#mainTitle` is still allocating its 48px `--row-h` grid track between `#mobileProjLabel` and `#mobileProjName`, producing the large dead band beneath `PROJECT 1 OF 3`; the `grid-template-rows: auto auto 1fr` override on `#mainBar` and `#mainTitle { display: none }` rule from the prior entry either didn't land or got reverted. (2) `#mobileProjDots` is empty despite three projects existing — `updateMobileProjHeader` builds dot buttons unconditionally but they're not visible, suggesting either the parent `#mobileProjStats` is collapsing (no min-height, no items rendering its counts row), or the dot row is being painted outside the viewport. (3) `#footCounts` still renders `0 OPEN 35 DONE` in the footer alongside `TASK MANAGEMENT V1.1`, duplicating the counts that should appear under the project name in `#mobileProjStats`. Fix all three together in a single CSS-only PR: add `#mainBar { grid-template-rows: auto auto 1fr }` and `#mainTitle { display: none }` inside the existing `@media (max-width: 700px)` block, add `#footCounts { display: none }` to the same block, and verify `#mobileProjStats` renders with `min-height: 44px` and its children (`#mobileProjCounts`, `#mobileProjDots`) are visible. Inspect a built dist bundle in DevTools mobile view to confirm the rules actually reach the element — if they're being shadowed by a later specificity match, escalate with `!important` since the existing CSS uses `!important` for the mobile font-size rules with the same justification (inline styles in main.js).
  - Behavior:
    1. `#mobileProjHeader` paints flush at the top of `#mainBar` with no gap above `PROJECT N OF M` and no gap below the project name
    2. `#mobileProjStats` renders the open/done counts on the left and the page dots on the right, each row 44px tall, on the same horizontal line directly under the project name with the standard 14px 16px 10px header padding
    3. Page dots show one dot per project, with the active dot scaled and accent-colored
    4. Footer at the ≤700px breakpoint shows only `TASK MANAGEMENT V1.1` (the version label) — open/done counts are gone from the footer entirely
    5. Desktop above 700px is unchanged: `#mainTitle` shows the breadcrumb + bulk desc toggle, footer shows full counts
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - No vertical gap between `PROJECT 1 OF 3` and `Task Management App` larger than the header's natural 6px gap
    - Three projects → three dots visible in the header stats row
    - Footer at ≤700px shows only the version label, no counts
    - `#bulkDescActions`'s functionality is still reachable on mobile via the drawer's "Expand all descriptions" toggle (the toggle routes through `bulkDescToggleBtn.click()` even with the button `display: none`)
    - Desktop layout regression-tested at 701px+ — breadcrumb still renders, footer counts still render
  - Implementation notes:
    - All changes are inside the existing `@media (max-width: 700px)` block in `style.css` — no JS changes required
    - The drawer's `drawerExpandAll` row already mirrors the bulk desc toggle's `expanded` class state via `getState: function() { return bulkDescToggleBtn.classList.contains('expanded'); }` — verify the button still exists in the DOM (just hidden) so this works
    - `#mainList` already begins below `#mobileProjHeader` in source order under `main2`; collapsing the `#mainTitle` track is the only change needed to bring it flush to the header
    - The previous entry's PR commit history should be reviewed to confirm whether these rules ever landed or got partially reverted — if they're already in the file but not applying, the diagnosis is CSS specificity, not missing rules
  - Out of scope: bottom sheet for pomodoro/music (entry 2 from the original STACK trio); page-dot wrap behavior with 6+ projects (separate audit entry already drafted); empty-state mobile mascot tuning
